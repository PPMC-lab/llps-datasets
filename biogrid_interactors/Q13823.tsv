Quantitative scores are calculated by CompPASS-Plus (Huttlin et al. Cell 2015, PMID: 26186194). The 0.75 threshold represents the top 2% of scores in HCT116.|Only scores from within the same cell line in BioPlex HCT (PMID: 33961781) should be compared directly.

Hits where all three replicates show a positive value after this subtraction are considered potential MECP2 interactors. The score represents the log2-transformed average of the adjusted binding intensity from three replicates.	-	BIOGRID
