Genetic interactions were quantitatively scored based on fitness defects that were estimated from the colony size of double versus single mutants. Genetic interactions were considered significant if they had an SGA score of epsilon > 0.16 for positive interactions and epsilon < -0.12 for negative interactions, and a p-value < 0.05.	-	BIOGRID
